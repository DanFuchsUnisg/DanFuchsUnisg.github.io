	<p>I'm a PhD student at the IWI at University of St.Gallen advised by Jan Marco Leimeister.</p>
		
	<p>I strive to conduct interdisciplinary research in the fields of Information Systems, Computer Linguistics, and Human-Computer-Interaction to increase learning success and education across all domains. To do so, I use techniques from Artificial Intelligence such as Natural Language Processing, Transfer and Deep Learning to build AI-powered education tools such as Intelligent-Tutoring-Systems or Conversational Agents.You can find information on my work on <a href="https://ai-for-education.com/">AI for Education</a></p> 

	<p>Most recently I have developed an adaptive Learning Support System for Argumentation Skills which has beneficial use for developing better writing and reasoning for students than traditional learning methods. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376732">(CHI 2020 full paper)</a>. Furthermore we have desgined a platform for educators to develop their own chatbpts without technical know-how <a href="https://mybot.uber.space/">My TeachingBot</a>.
