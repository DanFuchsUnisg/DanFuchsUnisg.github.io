	<h1>Hi there, I'm Thiemo Wambsganss</h1>

	<p>I'm a PhD student at the IWI at University of St.Gallen advised by Jan Marco Leimeister.</p>
		
	<p>I strive to conduct interdisciplinary research in the fields of Information Systems, Computer Linguistics, and Human-Computer-Interaction to increase learning success and education across all domains. To do so, I use techniques from Artificial Intelligence such as Natural Language Processing, Transfer and Deep Learning to build AI-powered education tools such as Intelligent-Tutoring-Systems or Conversational Agents.</p> 

I design interactive systems to facilitate better communication and collaboration among users. I have conducted a study to improve a current web survey system by using a chatbot (CHI 2019 full paper). Recently, we designed the chatbot, Poki, which manages and facilitates group chat discussion (CHI 2020 full paper, CSCW 2021 full paper).
